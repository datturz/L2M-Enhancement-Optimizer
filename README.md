## 🚀 Quick Start

2. **Double-click** `L2M_Optimizer.bat`
3. Follow the on-screen menu

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Windows OS (or any OS with Python)

### Installation

1. **Install Python** (if not already installed):
   - Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - ✅ **IMPORTANT**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

2. **Download this tool**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/L2M-Enhancement-Optimizer.git

## 💡 How It Works

### Tumbal System
- **Tumbal**: Sacrificial items that are destroyed to build "karma"
- **Karma**: Hidden server counter that increases success rate
- Each destroyed weapon adds ~3% to success rate (max 30%)

### Critical Timing
- **0-60 seconds**: 100% karma effectiveness ← ENHANCE NOW!
- **60-120 seconds**: 90% karma effectiveness
- **2-5 minutes**: 70% karma effectiveness
- **5+ minutes**: Karma expired, must restart

### Tumbal Success Problem
When tumbal succeeds instead of destroying:
- **0-1 destroyed** → Restart with new tumbal
- **2 destroyed** → Borderline (your choice)
- **3 destroyed** → Proceed acceptable
- **4+ destroyed** → Definitely proceed

## 📈 Optimal Strategies

### For +7 Enhancement
- Use 3-5 tumbal weapons
- Success rate: 40-50%
- Cost: 200-500 diamonds

### For +8 Enhancement
- Use 6-8 tumbal weapons

### For +9 Enhancement

## 🎯 Pro Tips

1. **Use Common Weapons as Tumbal** - Higher destroy rate (40% vs 33%)
2. **Prepare Extra Tumbal** - Expect 2-3 to succeed out of 8-10
3. **Chain Attempts** - If rare succeeds, immediately try unique
4. **Track Patterns** - Server has hot/cold streaks
5. **Stop on Failure** - Never chase losses

- **Diamonds**: Premium currency (cash shop)

## 📊 Success Rate Formula

Maximum Karma Boost = 30%
```
